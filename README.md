AI Virtual Mouse is a software that allows users to give inputs of a mouse to the system without using the actual mouse. To the extreme, it can also be called hardware as it uses an ordinary camera. A virtual muse can usually be operated with multiple input devices, which may include an actual mouse or computer keyboard. The virtual mouse uses a web camera with the help of different image processing techniques. Using figures detection methods for instant Camera access and a user-friendly interface makes it more easily accessible. The system is used to implement a motion-tracking mouse, a physical mouse that saves time and also reduces effort. The hand movements of a user are mapped into mouse inputs. A web camera is set to take images continuously. Most laptops today are equipped with webcams, which have recently been used in security applications utilizing face recognition. To harness the full potential of a webcam, it can be used for vision-based CC which would effectively eliminate the need for a computer mouse or mouse pad. The usefulness of a webcam can also be greatly extended to other HCI applications such as a sign language database or motion controller.
